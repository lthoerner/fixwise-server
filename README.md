# TechTriage
TechTriage is an inventory, ticket, and customer management software designed for use by electronics
repair businesses. It is currently in active development.

## Goals
Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of goals for the project:
- Competitive pricing compared to other cloud repair management software
- Perpetual licensing model for clients who wish to self-host
- Robust, auditable codebase (source-available)
- Well-documented plugin API for vendor integrations and extensibility of inventory database
- Easy-to-use, performant web UI
- Toggleable and configurable features
- Migration tools (tentative)

## Roadmap
We do not have an official roadmap as of yet because the project is still in very early development.
Stay tuned for more info!
